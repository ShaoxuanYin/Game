## 1.1Dynamic connectivity

`connected(a, b)==true` to show two item `a` and `b` is connected in the Relationship

## 1.2Quick-find

(eager approach)

Same id means elements in the same union components.

Union: change one set of id to another set.(edge connected also  )

`union() find()`

quick-find is too slow O($N^2$)

## 1.3Quick-union

 (lazy approach)

merge components containing `p` and `q`, set the id of `p`'s root to the id of `q`'s root. (like the tree's merge)

union(entry's root, target's root), `entry's root` at the below of the `target's root`
